Oarm. XX. ——Ad Maecenatem. ‹726-735.)

Anotmmffr. —Thou shalt have some poor Sabine, Maecenas, bottled at that time
when the echoes of the Vatican resounded thy praises. Thou drinkest Caecubum
and Calenian, but the vines of Falernum and Formiae are not for me.

1-12. The Sabine wine was sweet and palatable, but Horace calls it
vile, cheap, (vin ordinaire,) in compa-rison with the costly wines which
Maecenas drank at home. It was “ a thiu table-wine, of a reddish color,
attaining its maturity in seven years.'’ —The cantharus was a large,
double-eared goblet or drinking-cup, sacred to Bacchus, said by some
to have derived its name from its inventor, by others, from its being
made to resemble a beetle (κάνθαρος). —Horace put up his Sabine wine
in α Greek ear-then jar, in order that it might imbibe some of the ssavor
of the rich Greek wine which the jar had formerly contained and with
which it had become impregnated. —Iaevi (from lino) sc. pice: I sealed,
lit„ “I smeared.'’ “The cork of the teuta was covered with pitch or
gypsum, after the wine was put into it. Horace would at the same
time seal it with his own scal, and attach to it a label with the date
(indicated generally by the names of the consuls for the current year).
In saying that he did it with his own hand, he shows the pains he took
-to celebrate Maecenas's recovery.” —Datus (eet).-After a dangerous
illness, on his first appearance in the theatre, Maecenas was received
with a round of applause. The theatre must have been that of Pom-
peius, in the Campus Florae—Eques. Like Τ. Pomponius Atticus,
and like some illustrious commoners in England, Maecenas was con-
tented with the equestrian rank, and would take no higher. -Ut with
the subj. of result.-- The Tiber is Maecenas’s ancestral river as flowing
from Etruria.—Jooosa imago, i. e., E0h0.—Vat1cani.— The proper
quantity is Vde-teani, but poets often allowed themselves liberties with
the quantities of proper names.— The Formian hille by metonymy sor
the wines they produce.—Temperant mea pocula, flavor my yoblete‚
are mixed in my gobletS. It was the custom of the ancients to weaken
their wine with water, the dilution varying from one part of wine and
four of water, to two of wine and four or five of water, which last
(Henderson says) seems to have been the favorite mixture.

Garm. XXL-Ad Ohorum in Dianam et Apollinem. (726-732.)

Some festival in honor of Apollo and Diana seems to have suggested these verses,
in which a chorus of boys and girls are. called upon to sing the praises os these
deities, and of their mother Latona, and to beseech Apollo to turn the griefs of
war, famine, and plag-ue from Rome and her prince upon the heads of her enemies.
