X , LIFE OF HORACE.

to love, was the severest. wound that time could bring. “ The
shocks of Chance, the blows of Death '⁷ smote him heavily; and
the failure of youth, and spirits, and health, in the'inevitable
decay of nature, saddened the thoughtful poet in his solitude,
and tinged the gayest society with melancholy. Maecenas’s
health was a source of deep anxiety to him3 and one of the most.
exquisite Odes (Carm. 11. 17) addressed to that valued friend, in
answer to some outburst of despondency, while it expresses the
depth of the poet's regard, bears in it the tone of a man some-
what weary of the world. He declares that, if untimely fate
shall snatch away his patron, he will not survive him; and the
prophecy was fulfilled almost to the very let-ter. 'I'he same year
(A. U. c. 746, Β. c. 8) witnessed the death of both Horace and
Maecenas. The latter “led the way,'' (as the poet foretold)‚ com-·
mitting his friend, in almost his last words, to the care of Au-
gustus: Horati Flacci, ut mei, esto memor. On the 27th of No-
vember, when he was on the eve of completing his fifty—seventh
year, Horace himself died, of an illness so short and sudden that
he was unable to make his will in writing. He declared it verb-
ally before witnesses, leaving to Augustus the little which he
possessed. He was buried on the Esquiline Hill, near his patron
and friend Maecenas.

There are no authentic busts or medallions of Horace, and his
descriptions of himself are vague. He was short in stature, his
eyes and hair were dark, but the latter was early silvered with

gray. He suffered at one time with an affection of the eyes, ’

and seems to have been by no means robust in constitution. His
habits were temperate and frugal, as a rule, although he was far
from insensible to the charms of a good table and good wine,
heightening and heightened by the zest of good company. But
he seems to have had neither the stomach nor the taste for ha-
bitual indulgence in the pleasures of the table. Latterly he be-
came corpulent and sensitive to the severity of the seasons, and
sought at Baiae and Tibur the refreshment or shelter which his
mountain retreat had ceased to yield to his delicate frame.

> Of all his writings, Horace himself appears to have ascribed
the greatest value to the odes, and to have rested upon them his
claims to posthumous fame. They were the result of great labour,
as he himself indicates (Carni. 1V. 2, 27 sqq.); and yet they
bear pre-eminently the charm of simplicity and ease. He was
the first to mould the Latin tongue to the Greek lyric measures;
and his success in this difficult task may be estimated from the
fact that, as he was the first, so was he the greatest, of the Ro-
man lyrists. In airy and playful grace, in happy epithets, in
variety of imagery, and exquisite felicity of expression, the odes
are still unsurpassed among the writings of any period or lan-
guage. It is these qualities and a prevailing vein of genial and
sober wisdom‚ which imbue them with a charm quite peculiar,
