Garm. XVI. — Ad Maecenatem. (730.)

Anoumzm.— A stout prison and savage watch-dogs might have kept Danae from
harm: but Jove and Venus smiled, sor they knew that the god need but change
himself to gold, and the way would be clear before him. Gold penetrates through
guarda, through rocks; thereby fell the house os Amphiaraus, the Macedonian
won cities, stern admit-als are ensnared. And as it grows, the desire for more
grows too. A high estate 1 dread. The more a man denies himself, the more the
gods will give him. I fly from the rich to the contented‚ and am more indepen-
dent than any poor rich man in the world. My stream, and my little wood, and
my trusty field, are a happier portion than all Africa. I have not wealth, yet
poverty doth not pinch me; and is 1 wanted more, thou, Maecenas, art ready to
give it. My small income will go further by the restricting of my wants, than if

1 had all Lydia and Phrygia for my own. Who ask much, lack much. It is well
with him who has enough.
