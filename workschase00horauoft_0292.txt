however, both of the dat. and of the dep. part. can be seen: ‘⁴ thou who
first sang to the Lesbian citizen-'’)—Ferox bollo, (thouyh)fieree in war.
Illi. The verb haereo is here followed by the dat. Horace also con«
strues it with the abl. with in, and with the abl. alone.—uihi—-vo-
canti, be propitians to me whenever in due form I invoke thee.

Oarm. XXXIII. -— Ad Albium Tibullum. (725-729.)

Ascensum—come, Albius, do not be drawling pitisul poeti-y upon Glycera,
because she prefers a younger man. Pretty Lycoris loves Cyrus, Cyrus inclines
to Pholoe, who admit-es the vulgar sinner as the she-goat loves the wolf. Such
are Love's diversione, bringing oppositos under her yoke together. So it hup-
poned to me‚·—-n. tendor beart was attached to me, while Ι could not free myselt

Oarm. XXXIV. —Ad se Philosophantem. (727—731.)

In this ode, Horace shows the insufficiency of philosophy to supply the place
»f a religione saith. He had held the Epicurean notion that the gods exercise no
esu-e over hunum affairs; but, sturtled by the phenomenou of tlmnder in a cloud-
less sky. liis hem-t was impressed with a sense of divine power, and he makes a
mainly recantation of his erroneous belief.

1-16. Parcus, niggardly, sparing in offerings3 introquons, infrequent
in attendance on their worship.—1nsanionti⁸ sapientiae, an unwiee
wiedom, an unphilosophical philosophy, i. e., the tenets of the Epicu-
reans. A good instance of oxymoron.— The pathe he had lest, to which
Horace is forced to return, are those of the simple saith of his child-
hood, taught him by his pious father. -Diespiter=Jupiter. “The
Latin ιῙιι and Jovi, the Gr. Ζεύς, the Sanskrit Dyane or Dya (meaning
both sky and day) point to a. common root, signifying briqht. These
derivatives form a natural first term to express the idea. of God—the
Author of lv‘yffl, the Lord os heaven. In the Vedae the combination
Dyauepitar (=‘Sky Father’) is as frequent as Jupiter in Latin?
