EPISTVLARVM

LIBER Ι.

Horace's Epistles are the work os his mature years, when nu his powers were
developed‚ his knowledge of the world complete, aud his tanto ripe and mellow.
llence they are, by universal confession, his most perfect compositione. Critics
unite in eulogizing their ‘⁶ exquisite urbanity,” their ‘⁶ calm -nd commanding good
sense‚'’ their ’⁴ extraordinary and undeflnable charms.'’ They have all the grace
o'f the most animated and reflned conversation. ⁸⁶ 'l'hey arc the Spectator of the
Roman supper—tames. Shrewd sense is relieved by seasonable anecdota a general
rule of life by its p=·rtinent application; the wisdom of ege and the sullies ol· youth
are reconciled; and the individua! interest is extended and elevated by its connec-
tion with the manners of the time and with the universal instincta of polite society in
all ages. As miniatum-painters of the humours and foibles ol· mankind, Addison,
Fontaine, and charles bamb alone approach the· curione selicity of lioruce.”

The poet himself styled his Epistles as well as his Satires Sermones, in allusion
to the unpretending conversational tone in which he wrote. 'l'he greater perfec-
tion of their meti-e, and their flnished style, however, remove them sar-ther than
the Satires from the ‹iomainof the Musa pedestris. Their persona} and subJ'ective
character gives a peculiar charin to these “ripest fruits” of a genius ‘’alike in-
structed by Life and Art.’' ,

Epist. Ι. —Ad Maecenatem. (⁷34.)

, nome time aster Horace had published his three books of Odes, and had, as it
appears. laid aside that sort os writing, it seems that Maecenas, and probably his
other friends, begged him to return to> it. 'that is the obvious meaning of the
remonstrance with which the Epistle opens. Horace expresses an earnest wish
to retire into privacy, to abandon poetry‚ and to devote himself to the study of
philosophy and virtue, which he recommends as the only true wisdom.
