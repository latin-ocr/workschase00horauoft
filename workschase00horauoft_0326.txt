wood5‚ streams, and hell’s bloody sentinel‚ and Ixion, and Tityos, and the daughters
of Danaus. Let Lyde hear of their crime and punishment, and how one was mer-
ciful and span-ed her young husband's lise, saying, “Rise up; begone, lest the sleep
of death overtake thee. They have sprung upon their prey. My beart is not as
their beart. Ι will do thee no harm. Let my father do with me as he will, yet
go thou, while night and love protect thee. Farewell‚ and when I am gone, en-
grave a word of sorrow on my tomb.'’

1-29. Te magistro, abl. absolute. — Nervis. abl.-- Immanis ,ianitor
aulae, the fierce pov-ter of the palae-e. Ο. takes immunis with aulae,
“vast.”—Furiale‚ jury-like. -19. Manet, from martura—Quin et,
Nay even. — Risit. The poets are fond of using a verb in the sinyular
with several nominatives. It calls attention to each om· of the subjecte.
virginum, i. e, the Danaides.—- Inane like its opposite plemen is limited
by the gen. —Pereuntis, running through, runninq out. -— Sub Orco, in
the realm os Orcus (the king of the lower world).

30—52. Ram—majus, sor what greater (crime) could they (have eom·
miteed) ,ἲ - 31. Pettium, they had the beart, they could brinq themselveae.
Una, i. e. Hypermnestra.—-Faoe nuptiali, of the nuptial torch, as we
should say of the bridal veil. At ancient marriages the bride, escorted
in the evening from her father’s house to that of her husband, was pre-
ceded by a. boy bearing a lighted toreh.—Splendide mendax, maq-
nvficently false. A noble oxymoron. Danaus had compelled all his
daughters to promise that they would murder their husbands. Hy-
permnestra’s breach of her engagement is praiseworthy, because a
wicked promise is better broken than kept—Faue, elude, escape.—
Sorores (sc. tuae, to correspond with socerum), thy sistere-indam—

Oarm. XII.-Ad Neobulen.

Amnum. —Poor women! we must not love, we must not drown care in wine,
or a cruel guardian scolds us to death. Alas. Neobfile! thou canst not spin nor
work, for love of Hebrus, so beautiful as he hathes in the waters os Tiber, a horse-
man like Bellerophon, unsurpassed in the combat and the race, in piercing the
flying deer or catching the lurking boar.

Upon the whole, I prefer to take this ode, with many recent editors, as a solil-
oquy. R. takes verses 5-16 as Neobule’s quotation of her uncle’s taunts; it is not
unusual, however, to use the second person in an address to one’s sels. Some con-
sider the whole ode as the address of the poet to N eobule.

1-15. Miserarum, se. sors or condicia— Dare ludum, to qivefullplay.
lavere, an old form = lavare. — Metuentes, from sear of. - Supply
