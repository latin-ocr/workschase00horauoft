admired by Cicero. His son (Sat. 11. iii. 239), the heir of his vast for-

law of Augustus. After he had been praetor and consul, he undertook

adornment of public buildings and the celebration of gaines on a splen-
did scale, and in large donations to the people. He was applauded in

in commemoration of the naval victories of Augustus, to which he gave
the name Porticus Argonautarum: the latter is perhaps the one referred

life. Agamemnon refused him sepulture. He loved the Phrygian cap-
tive Tecmessa, who was given him as his prize.
