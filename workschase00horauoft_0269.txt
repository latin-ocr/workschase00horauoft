Orelli and others in understanding this passage as meaning, (in Y.'s
words) “the pride of others is, in a set poem to celebrate Athens (or
Attica), and tao gain an olive wreath from every part of it, i. e., from
every legend, to gain poetic same.'’ Bentley, Con„ and others explain

wreath for literary merit was properly of ivy(1. 1, 29). Here it is sup-

oeneur.— Signis. The standards, set up in the ground, in Roman
cumps, in front of the general’s tent, were richly decorated with plates
os gold or silver. —Tenent‚ tenebit. From the difference of the tenses,
we may inser that Plancus was still in camp—Tiburis tui, i. e., of
thy villa at Tibur. —Patrem. Telamon.

22-27. Lyaeo, with wine. This name os Bacchus is very appropriate
here, sor it means the deliverer from carc (λύειν). - Populea. The white
