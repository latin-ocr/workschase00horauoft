Garm. IX. —Ad Lollium. (738—742.)

Anounssr.-Think not that my verses will die: though nome-r stands first
among poets, Pindar. Simonides, Alcaeus, Stesichorus, Anacreon, Sappho,——· these
all survive. Helen was not the first woman that loved; nor Ilium the only city
that has been sacked3 nor the heroes of the Iliad all that have t'ought3 but the
rest have been sorgotten, because they have no poet to sing of them. Bnried vir·
tue is little better than buried dulness. 1 will not, therefore, let thy labors pass
unsung, Lollium thy sagacity and uprightnees, thy mind free from avarice and
secure from corruption. It is not the possessor of riches that is wealthy‚ but the
man who knows how to use the gists of Heaven, and to endure poverty, who hutes
corruption, and is ready to lay down his lise sor his country or his friends.

1. Ne forte eredas, that thou shouldaet not per-chance suppose. Verses
5-12 give the yrounds for not supposing that Horaoe's verses will die.—
3. Horace is proud of having introduced lyrio poetry among the Ro-
mane. — 7. Ceae, i. e. of Simonides of Ceos. —— 7. Minaoes. This epi-
thet applies to the martial and revolutionary odes of Alcaeus.—
8. Graves, diymfied.-12. Puellae, i. e. Sapph0.-13-16. Arsit gov-
erns crines, as mirata governs the other accusatives· hie—cultus,
state, pomp, splendor: (referring to his outward appearance, his bear-
ing, dress, etc.) —18. Non semel—vexata, not once alone was a Troy
besieged (lit. harassed, molested); (other cities have suffered as well.)
So Ο. Others, as R„ N„ Br„ apply the statement to Troy exclusively:
“More than once was Troy besieged? viz. by Hercules and Telamon
(strab. XIII. 1, 32), and by the Amazone, as well as afterwards by the
Greeks—29. Inertiae. Poetical use of the dat. after dietat, instead
of the abl, with ab. In the same way Horace always uses diecrepare,
differre, dissentire, dissidere with the dat. G. 177, 2 (end).

35. Rerum prudens, experienced in affairs, hence saqacious in (bus-
iness or) action ‚· full of worldly wisdom and knowledge of the world.—
36. Rectus, ercet, implies both unbem, unmoved, and morally upriyht.
37-39. The nouns vindex and consul (strictly appositive) are used
like adjectives to define animus, which itself is used where we might
have had the personal pronoun Tu es, etc. Bent. collecte many in-
stanees of am'mus spoken of in the same way as a person3 animus aeeti-
νησίον, contemptor, dominus, rem, eto.-— 41 Judex, (as) a qood andfm'thsul
judgye ,· appositive, as is victor, to animus. —42. Alto, losty. —Nocen-
lium, qs the wicleed. — Catervas, troops (of tempters). 0., N. R. takes
if„ of enemies in war. —44. Hath carried safe hia arms, victorious. Mc.—
45. Occupat, claime. -51, Non ille timidus, noaefeaaeful he, eto.
