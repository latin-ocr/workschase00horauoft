426 INDEX OF PROPER NAMns.

Philodemus. An Epicurean philosopher. Some of his epigrams,
and his treatises on music and ou rhetoric, have been deciphered among
the Herculanean MSS.

Phraates. Phraates the IV.‚ expelled for cruelty from the throne
of Parthia, but restored to his throne by the Scythians. He submitted
to Augustus.

Pisones. See note A. Ρ. 24.

Pitholeon‚ (or Pitholaus,) a freedman of M. Otacilius, who wrote
calumnious poems, and epigrams in which Greek words were mixed
with Latin.

Plancus, 1.. Munatius, a man engaged in almost every contest in
the civil wan, and on every side. At his proposition Octavius was
saluted by the name of Augustus. The advice of Horace to Plancus
(Carm. 1. vii.), that he should surrender himself to pleasure, was con-
genial to his habits. The first lines of the ode are addressed with great
propriety to a former Praefect of the province of Asia, who must have
known Greece well. The villa of Plancus at Tibur was no doubt fami-
liar to the poet, and the restless life of the adventurer might wisely

Plotius, a poet named, with Varius and Virgil, as among the dearest

He continued to frequent the school, and, on the death of Xenocrates,
(Β. c. 315), became its head.

Pollio, G. Asinius, a distinguished orator, poet, and historiau of the
Augustan age. He fought in the civil war on the side of Julius Caesar.
Antonius appointed him governor of Gallia Transpadana, where he
had the difficult task of settling the veter-ans in the lands assigned
them, and saved the property of the poet virgil, at Mantua, from con-

ciliation of Octavianus and Antonius at Brundisium. In Β. c. 39 he
was sent by Antonius, with an army, against the Parthini, an Illyriau
