what was called the solid day. ‘⁴ Solidus signifies that which has na
vacant part or space.”

21, 22. Horace delights in pictures like this (especially attractiva
in a warm country like Italy), of taking rest under grateful shade and
by the side of murmuring &reama—Membra, acc. of specification,
with etratus (from sterno). — The arbutus (arbutus unedo, or strawbcrry-
tree) is a beautiful shrub, and remarkable for the bright color of its
ever-green leaves.—Lene‚ softly whispering‚ gently murmuring.—
Caput, spring, “ well-head.'’— sabran, i. e., to the nymphs. “ Shrines
were usually built at the fountain-head of streams, dedicated to the
nymphs that protected them.”

23. The lituus or clariora was a bronze trumpet, curved at one ex-
tremity like an augur's staff. It was sharp or shrill in tone, and‘was
used by the cavalry. The tuba, trumpet, was straight (as its name
denotes) and of a deep tone, and used by the infantry.-Lituo (abl.
governed by permixtus)= litui nonita, a brief mode of expression com<
mon iu all languages. ,

24. matribus. ‘⁴ Dat. of the agent with the passive part. detentatast
But notice that, while the abl. with a or ab denotes the agent directly
and simply, the more subtile construction with the dat. marks the action
rather as affecte'ny the intereat-³ of the agent, or as standing} to him in ᾳ
certain relation .· as here, ware, to momen α thing] abhorred, (“ war, the
detested of mothers‚” Bl.) There are a few cases, however, in the poets,
where this original distinction between the dat. and the abl. with ab
seems to have been lost sight of, as there is a natural tendency, m all
languages, to the occasional disregard of distinctions so delicate.

25. Detestatffi a deponent part. used passively, as modulatus (I. 32,
5), metatus (II.15,15)‚ab0mi·natus (Epod. 16, 8). “Deteetatus is
nowhere else used passively, except by the law-writers, who use it of
one convicted by evidence.”— Sub Jove, under the open oley, as sub
dico (the latter word being derived from the same root as the Iov or
Ia which in composition with pater makes Jupiter or Juppiter; com-
pare interdiu). Ennius: Aspice hoc sublime candem, quem invocant
omnes Jovem. The Romans often use Jupiter for the heavens or their
phenomena.-— Manet, i. e. pernoctat.

27. Catulis, strictly, dat. of advantage3 but see note on matribus
(24); C. 157, 13 Η. 3883 A. 232, b, cg G. 352. How do we know that
catulis is not abL? (C. 173, 13 Η. 415, Ι.; A. 2463 G. 403.)

28. Teretes (smooth‚ rounded), firmly twisted, well wronqht5 some
translate taperinq, in allusion to the conical shape of the nets3 plagas,
nete, toils.
