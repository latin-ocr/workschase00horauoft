Oarm. V. - In canidiam. (714-720.)

There is much likeness between this singular Ode and part of the eighth Satin-e
of the first book. A scene is represented in which Canidia is the chief actress.
She is passionateiy in love with one Varus, whom she cans an old sinner, but whose
heart she is resolved to win. '1⁸0 this end she resorts to magica! phinei-s, for the
composition of which, in company with three other witchcs‚ Sagana, Velia, and
Folia, she gcts a boy of good family, strips him naked. and hui-ies him up to his
chin in a nole, in order that there. with food put before him, he might wither

“ away in the midst of longing‚ and so his liver might form, in conjunction with

other ingredients, a love-potion‚ to be administered to the faithless Varus. What
could have put such a scene into Horace’s head, it is hard to say.

Canidia is one of the few names of which we may be sure that it represents n
real person. The scholiasts say that her real⁴ name was Grandia, and that she was

a N eapolitan seller of persumes. Ι 3

the rushing of a boar is not a bad simile. It is intelligible to any one

along the open plain faster than dog or rider can follow him. Mc. -
