Garm. Ι. - Ad Asinium Pollionem. (724-727.)

Auamma—The civil wars,—a danger-ons theme is thine‚ and treacherous is
the ground- thou treadest. Leave the tragic Muse for a while, and thou shalt
return to her when thou hast finished the historian's tasR, Ο Pollio! advocate,
senator, conqueror! Even now 1 seem to hear the trumpet and the chirion, the
flashing of arms, and the voices os chiefs, and the whole world subdued but the
stubborn heart of Cato. The gods of Africa have offered his victors’ grandsons
