not for ever gazing from a distance at the pleasant fields of Tibur, buried in the
magnificence and the uproar, tho wealth and the sruoke, of Rome. The rich man
often likes to sup at the poor man’s table. The days of drought are come bacin
the shepherd seeks the shade, the flock the stream, not a brealh is on the river-
banks: but thou art distracting thyself with imaginary dangers. neuwen has
wisely hidden the future, and does but smile at our fem-s. Live for the preseut;
all else is like the stream, that now flows in peace, now is swolleu to a fiood, and
sweeps all with it to the sea.. He lives happy who lives to-day, and leaves to-
morrow to Heaven, seeing that Jove himself cannot undo what is done. Fickle
Fortune changes from day to day. If she stays with me, 1 am glad; is she flies,
1 am resigned. If the storm rages, 1 have no memhandise to sear sor, and can
put out into any sea with sasety in my little burk.
