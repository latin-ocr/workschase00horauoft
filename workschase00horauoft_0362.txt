SATIRARVM

LIBER Ι.

It was a boast of the Romans that Satire (Satira or Satura) is a kind of poetry
peculiar to their nati0n‚ and developed independently of Grecian influences.
Horace had as his model in this style of composition a Roman knight named
Caius Lucilius, born B. O. 148. 'l'he same name had already been applied to a dir-
ferent kind of poetry by Ennius (born B. C. 239). The word itseli'‚ derived from
satur, (after the analogy of lanx satura, a dish filled with various kinds of fruit,)
means a mallaey, miscellany, farrago, olio, olla podrida. It was applied to poetry
with reference to the diversity sometimes os the subject· ‚treated of, sometimes
of the kinds of verse introduced3 from the latter characteristic to the sutires of
Ennius, from the former to those of Lucilius and Horace.

It was the object of Lucilius, in his medleys, to paint the life. the spirit, and tho
manners of Rome in his day; and in the inroads of luxury, and the gradun! dccay
of the ancient discipline, he found ample occasion of ridicule and censure. Hence
his compositione often bore the character which we call satiricum and for a like
reason we find the same character in the similar works of Hom: yet that this
was not then considered as the essentia! quality of Satira appears from several of
the satires of Horace (e. g. 11. vii.) in which few or no truces of it appear. Horace's
Satires are, in the main, humorons pictures of the times and manners. That he
himself applied to them the name satirae appears from 11. 1, 1 and ὅ, 17. He also
calls them, together with the Epistles‚ Ser-vaona, as written in unassuming style,
in the language of familiar conversation.

Satira 1. (716-719.)

'l'his satire treats of the universally prevalent vice of dissatisfaction with one’s
own lot aud position in life3 the eager desire of possessing more than others3
, and the avarice which would always accumulate, and never begin to enjoy what
has been acquired. The poet shows that men's discontent with what they are and
with what they have, arises from their looking enviously at those before them,
instead of comparing their own advantages with the lot of men less favored thau
themselves. Thus they lose all quiet euj0yment,and fill their whole lives with
the toil and restless competition of a race.

hemo) vivat, we take a universal subject for the affirmative clause,
(quisque) laudet. This construction is frequent in Greek and Latin,
and sometimes occurs (perhaps accidentally) in English: e. g. Sydney
Smith (cited by Y.): “ No one would laugh to see a little child fall, and
would be shocked to see such an accident happen to an old man.'’—
