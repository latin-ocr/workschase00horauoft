Lamia, 1.. Aelius, of a very noble family ς a warm friend of Horace3
cos. Α. u. c. 756. Horace speaks of him (Epist. 1. xiv.) as mourning
the death of his brother Quintus.

Laomedon, king of Troy, whom Neptune and Apollo, having dis-
pleased Jupiter, were condemned to serve for wages. When they had
built for him the walls of Troy, he refused to give them the reward he
had promised.

Ῑιοιιοοηόθ, perhaps a fictitious person, or perhaps the whole ode ad-
dressed to her (1. xi.) is a translation from the Greek.

Licinius Murena, 1... called by adoption Δ. Terentius Varro nu-
rfina, brother of Terentia the wife of Maecenas, and (by adoption) of
Proculeius. He was of the college of augurs, and had a house at For.-
miae. After Horace had written to him the tenth ode of the second
book, recommending an unambitious life, he engaged or was impli-
cated in the conspiracy of Fannius Caepio against the life of Augustus,

Ligurinas, an imaginary youth. ’ Ὗ

Lollius, M„ Palicanus (or Paullinus). It may be that Horace
knew Lollius's better qualities only, and that it was partly to console
him aster his defeat in Germany A. u. c. 738 that the Ode 1v. ix. was
written. He had served with distinction as Propraetor in Gaul, and

was consul with Lepidus A. U. c. 733. Horace did not live to hear
of his rapacity in the East, which induced him to take bribes of the Par-

thians. His guilt was betrayed to Augustus, and he slew himself*
to escape public disgrace. It is singular that Horace should have
chosen to celebrate the contempt of wealth as one of the virtues of Lol-

Lollius Maximus, (perhaps sou of the preceding) addressed in two
