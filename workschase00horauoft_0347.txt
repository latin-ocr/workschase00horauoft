ertten in honor of Tiberius, and corresponding to the fourth ode, which ex-
tolled the wau-like deeds os hie younger brother Drusus.

Anulum—With what honore shall we perpetuate thy virtues, Ο mightleet
etprincea, whooe strength the insoleutvindeuci have felt? With great slaugliter

ticularly common in the Greek poete) see my note on Cicero’s Tmo.
