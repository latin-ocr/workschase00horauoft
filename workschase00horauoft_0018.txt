xiv mermes 01³· HonAcr..

Strong and lively, the proper metre for appeal and encouragement‚ exhortation
and admonitiou.

The first verse, beginning with a monosyllabic basis, consists of two halves3 the
third verse is the doubling of the first of those halves3 the fourth verse is a pure
refrain, combining the second halves of the two preceding kinds of verse. The
Alcaic strophe, then, is like a composition in which a musical thought, after it
has impressed itself upon the ear by repetition, is resolved into its elements and
further carried out. ’

Horace employs this metre more than any other, and it is hence often called
the Horatian stanza. (Ι. 9, 16, 17, 26, 27, 29, 31, 34, 35, 37 ς ΙΙ. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13,
14, 15, 17, 19, 20; 111. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 17, 21, 23, 26, 29: IV. 4, 9, 14,15.)

IX. The first Archilochian strophe, in which the dactylis hexameter alternatos
with the minor Archilochian verse :

ιεῑ.ιπ ιμῷΙισι

11νυ

ΔυυΙΔυ

 

 

 

Δνυ Lau

The Archilochian strophes all express a certain sedness. The first is elegiae,
with a prevailing tone of melancholy, while the falling rhythms of the shorter
verse seem to represent hopelessness and resignation. (IV. 7.)

Χ. The second Archilochian strophe,· the dactyzic hexameter followed bytho
iambilaeyic or the iambim-dactylic verse .-

The iambic dimeter, here interposed between the two members of the first Ar-
chilochian strophe, expresses encouragement. (Ep. 13.)

11. The fourth Archilochian strophe, consisting of the-preater Archilochian
verse followed by an iambic trimeter catalectic:

This metre resembles the Archilochian strophe, and like that expresses melan-
choly thoughts. (Ι. 7, 28.)
