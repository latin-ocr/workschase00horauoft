ARGUMENT. ⁷— Lovely daughter of a lovel y mother, destroy those beautiful verses
how thou wilt. Cybffle, Apollo, Liber, agitate not their votaries’ hearts as anger
does, which is stopped neither by sword, nor by waves, nor by 11το, 1101· by thun-

9-12. Irae, sc. mentem quaciaria—The best 81001 for swerd-blades
came from Noricum on the Danube. —Neo—tumultu. Some (as N„
Mc.) understand this of the actual falling of the skies3 (cf. ei fractae
illabatur orbis, III. 3, ¹7),· but it is better to take it as a bold figure of
the descent of Jupiter upon the earth, with thunder and lightnings.
Observc the correspondence of the sound and sense 111 111080 words, in
