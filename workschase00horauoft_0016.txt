THE METRES OF HORACE.

ἥκω-.-

Is the Satires and Epistles‚ Horace uses the dactylic hexameterg yet,1n the
Satires, his Musa pedestris purposely assumes a careless and easy tone. “The
approach to prose in Horace's verse is seen, sor instance, in his sreedom with re·
gurd to elision‚ particularly that of the monosyllabic particles nam, dum, cum, si,

which is contrary to the epic usage; in some cases of synaeresis, as ιννῖἷιί, φιΐαᾱ,

υἱηάιηιῖἇεω·; in syncopes, as caldior, soldum,· and contractioris, as divisse, sur·

resve. In the construction of the verse, also, we observe an intentional accumn· '

lation of spondees, whereas the well-framed epic line delights us by a testesul
variety of dactyles and spondees.”

In the Odes and Epodes eighteen meti-es or systems of verse are recognized, a
list of which here follows. Further details may be obtained from any of the
Grammars.

1. The minor Asclepiadean system, each stanza consisting of four minor Ascle-

madian verses:

There is something noble in *the effect of the choi-iambe, and the steady march
of the verse expresses calm essurance. Horace has used this metre thrice, when
he speaks with losty inspiration of the dignity of poetry aud his own calling us a
bai-d. (Ι. 1; 111. 303 IV. 8.)

11. The first Asclepiadean strophe, in which the Glyconic verse alternetes with

the· minor Asclepiadem .-

With less elevation and repose, this metro has more pathos end a more varied
movement than the preceding. (Ι. 3, 13, 19, 36; 111. 9, 15, 19, 24, 25, 28; IV. 1, 3.)

111. 'l'he second Asclepiade‘an strophe, consisting of three minor Asclepiadem
verses, followed by a Glyconic .·

The falling effect of this strophe is appropriate for the exprecsion of modesty,
apprehensIOn, despondency‚ or longing. (Ι. 6, 15, 24, 333 11. 12: ΠΙ. 10, 16 ; 1v.
6,12.) ..
